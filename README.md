# linux_file
My .vimrc file. It includes some basic settings, and several addons such as YouCompleteMe, NERDTree,Ctrlp,Airline...
The addons can be installed after install vundle by
```shell
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
There are something not very well, I should modify it latter.
